# Package Router

This is a program designed to minimize mileage for a package delivery service while meeting package delivery constraints. It utilizes a Greedy Algorithm to determine the nearest address for delivery. A hash table with chaining was implemented to store package information and a command-line interface is used to control the program.

# Demo

Once the program is ran, the user will be prompted to select an option.

If the user chooses package lookup, they can enter a package ID and get the information for that package.

If the user chooses to check the package status by time, all package information will be displayed with their status at that time:
